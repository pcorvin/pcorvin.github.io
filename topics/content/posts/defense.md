I love defensive metrics over everything. They have something of a randomness factor to this statistical game of baseball. You might ask: Why random? 

There’s a lot of confusion and misinformation out there, so I’d love the opportunity to set it straight. I’ll outline the metric I’m most familiar with (UZR) and then dive into the other one (DRS). This is a specific write-up to unpack the overall complexity in defensive metrics for position players, especially under the circumstance of the respective pitchers & the ball in play.

*Edit:* Thank you Bailey for covering [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yT0dWF4BTbk). I might nevertheless add context in the future.
