       <title>LLM benchmarks are not informing their actual performance.</title>

       <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a high-level analysis on current benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) that are developed by OpenAI,Athropic, Mistral et al. Note that I do not have an immediate answer on how to solve this, yet wanted tohighlight a &amp;ldquo;devil&amp;rsquo;s advocate&amp;rdquo; answer to existing cries of LLMs to rule everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am by no means an expert in LLMs, nor foundational models (who truly is?) but I somewhat stuck with Deep Learning for quite a bit,although the focus back then &amp;amp; now was a bit different. The famous &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Attention is all you need&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; paper wasinteresting when it came out, especially for auto-encoder structures in feature abstraction and that was basically it. GPT-2 was also interesting, butnot really worth using, nor at a scale where it mattered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Couple of years latter and boom, it escalated. Business rely on foundations models &amp;amp; raise gargantuan seed rounds, mostly without looking atthe fundamentals checking whether it &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; makes sense to use foundational models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the main drivers to choose your LLM are benchmarks, which tell you how much better one is relative to the other. Peoplewould rely on a 85.9% MMLU with most of them not knowing what is actually means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We thus want to dive into the most common benchmarks, why they do not always (I know, clickbait) reflect on the actual performance&amp;amp; why you should not always take the overall leader of the LLM Leaderboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-the-main-benchmarks&#34;&gt;What are the main benchmarks?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might have checked in on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard-old/open_llm_leaderboard&#34;&gt;Hugging Face LLM leaderboard&lt;/a&gt;, whichrepresents the industry standard for comparison of LLMs. To have a more complete picture, a sample of SoA metrics willbe represented by this bunch with their category highlighted in &lt;em&gt;italic&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/mmlu&#34;&gt;MMLU&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt; - Multitask accuracy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rowanzellers.com/hellaswag/&#34;&gt;HellaSwag&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;em&gt;reasoning&lt;/em&gt; - Understanding situations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/openai/human-eval&#34;&gt;HumanEval&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt; - Python coding tasks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/openai/grade-school-math&#34;&gt;GSM-8K&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;em&gt;math/reasoning&lt;/em&gt; - Grade school math&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03874&#34;&gt;MATH&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;em&gt;math&lt;/em&gt; - Math problems with 7 difficulty levels&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that these metrics represent their respective category, although you might highlight a missing metric orthat some of these are outdated already: bear with me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-wrong-with-them&#34;&gt;What is wrong with them?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course I selected some metrics which would benefit the cause and are confirming the initial thesis highlighted at thebeginning. Let us dive into the respective categories&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;knowledge&#34;&gt;Knowledge&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;MMLU is not good. Plain and simple, effectively bad that the community already developed a successor called &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01574&#34;&gt;MMLU-Pro&lt;/a&gt;, whichinherits parts of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MMLU stands for Massive Multitask Language Understanding and should represent a general knowledge database, which aggregatesquestions &amp;amp; answers on various topics from different sources. You see the catch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benchmark questions contain wrong answers to questions, no answer at all or bad formulation of questions. Furthermore, the splitin topics, their share &amp;amp; what sources are taken into account are not fully documented. If you are interestedin the taxonomy and what can be done better, feel free to access the paper &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04127&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, Hugging Face &amp;amp; their newest iteration of the LLM leaderboard (&lt;a href=&#34;https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard&#34;&gt;different link than above&lt;/a&gt;)included MMLU-Pro, which has revisited questions but nevertheless leaves open questions on the sources of answers and checksystematically, which of them are correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HumanEval suffers from the same fate, as the coding examples and their narrative are ambiguous withmost of the examples are too simple to be reflected in complex developer environment (hello Co-Pilot!).A new adoption can be driven by &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Leolty/repobench&#34;&gt;RepoBench&lt;/a&gt;, which takes working Github production repositoriesas comparison for auto-completion systems. Performance of LLMs on these remains low, especially because of the diversityof tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;reasoning&#34;&gt;Reasoning&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;HellaSwag reaches saturation. It is too easy for LLMs to reach near human performance. Are they as good as humans?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not really, it is mainly due to most of the information being shared in datasets already or leakages happening in trainings.This effectively is too easy for models having access to more data and inference with web crawling services. Looking forother metrics to take into account, Claude &amp;amp; GPT4o repeatedly proposed HellaSwag as alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexisbcook/data-leakage&#34;&gt;data leakage&lt;/a&gt; becomes increasingly common, where  models were possibly trained on benchmark data oron data very similar to benchmark data. GSM-8K is an example for it, which then do not assess the general performanceof the LLM but rather overfitting to the specific data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;math&#34;&gt;Math&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mathematical logic remains a big if for LLMs with a number of recurring posts about basic operators not being correctly used&amp;amp; interpreted. MATH does a great job at this &amp;amp; reflects the complexity of math problems in high school. Models do not performwell in this metric specifically,  as the combination of mathematical formula &amp;amp; plain text becomes more complex to understand.Current models (Status 07.2024) stick within the low 50s, compared to 80-90s in pure language-based tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case you are interested in strong mathematical performance, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/ai-solves-imo-problems-at-silver-medal-level/&#34;&gt;non-LLM deep learning networks&lt;/a&gt;which faired much better under pressure on a higher level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;changes--general-benchmarking-sanity&#34;&gt;Changes &amp;amp; general benchmarking sanity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A benchmark is only as good as its data. And metrics might wear out. Metrics get renewed once a plateauing of currentperformance can be observed. Nevertheless, this opens up the question what the actual benchmark should be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Practical &amp;amp; realistic benchmarks such as RepoBench or the Math Olympiad would be great comparisons, yet might fail to validatethe performance due to the higher complexity. The current times demand a flexible framework given the fast pace at whichmodels are iterated over and achieve new limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, consumers &amp;amp; users should think about their testing suite and what matters most to them. If knowledge basesis what you are looking for, kindly ignore math &amp;amp; reasoning to fully focus on how good a LLM can retrieve &amp;amp; undertand datathrough your own RAG infra. If you want to build an AI assistant for childern in primary school, math problems might be a majorfactor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, do not blindly trust labs publishing the newest results and stressing that their model is the best. Do yourown research and decide what matters most to you and how you can benefit most from what is currently available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As usual, it depends on your use case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in the evolution of LLM comparison, have a look at the Hugging Face blog of the LLM leaderboard.They do their best to keep the comparison as neutral &amp;amp; up to date as possible with explanations on the changes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

       <title>Defense Industry &amp; Strategy in Austria as example of major NATO procurement</title>
       <link>https://pcorvin.github.io/posts/austria/</link>
       <pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
       
       <guid>https://pcorvin.github.io/posts/austria/</guid>
       <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an exemplary overview of a local defence industry and shedding some light on what is currently within the arsenal of NATO armies.If you have any other example or comments, feel free to reach out!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am from Austria is not only the unofficial hymn of the central European country, but also what I tell people asking me where I am from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A first touchpoint apart from Schnitzel &amp;amp; skiing is the compulsory military service still in place, which somewhat makes sense for neutral countries (Hi Switzerland!).As I had to fulfill it in 2014, little did I know about how the cogs &amp;amp; wheels are turning regarding procurement of military equipment.Back then, the tools at disposal were by no means modern and limited investment meant a bleak peak into the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This seems to be no different to other defense apparati in Europe, where legacy platforms are maintained and only ever since the recentconflicts in Ukraine &amp;amp; Israel, modern stacks are applied &amp;amp; tested. Modernizing these systems (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://helsing.ai&#34;&gt;Helsing&lt;/a&gt;) orstarting completely new platforms (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://anduril.com&#34;&gt;Anduril&lt;/a&gt;) are only starting to win specific contracts against existing primes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-taking-austria-to-compare-it-to-nato&#34;&gt;Why taking Austria to compare it to NATO?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Austria is not part of the NATO (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_State_Treaty&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more explanation) but nevertheless represents a great case study on how &amp;ldquo;Western&amp;rdquo; countriestry to modernize their fleet but still spend a majority on flagship &amp;amp; existing platforms, diving into somewhat newer paradigms of the 2000sand only slightly touching new platforms to shift to a more dynamic arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main point focuses on the different systems &amp;amp; tools leveraged in the past years, with some outlook on how they can be merged in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-old-guard-traditional-arms-procurement&#34;&gt;The old guard: traditional arms procurement&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the most prized assets in the defense sector, two names will be directly flagged: &lt;a href=&#34;https://eu.glock.com/en&#34;&gt;Glock&lt;/a&gt;&amp;amp; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.steyr-arms.com/en/&#34;&gt;Steyr&lt;/a&gt;, both local firearms producers.The former notorious pistol leveraged by regular police forces as well as special forces of the US, Germany &amp;amp; France. The latter exports itsAUG, an assault rifle, is used across the world, although also in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reuters.com/article/world/syria-rebels-bolstered-by-new-arms-but-divisions-remain-idUSBRE91P0PV/&#34;&gt;parts you might not want to see it&lt;/a&gt;.Apart from firearms, Steyr-Daimler-Puch, unrelated to the firearms department and within General Dynamics, focuses on their Pandur vehicle.This armoured personnel carrier (APC) is built for internal usage but got recently exported to Belgium, Slovenia, Ukraine &amp;amp; the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These exports represented around 75% of the procured defense products out of Austria in 2021. Nearly all buyers are NATO countries, apart fromspecific NATO allies (Saudi Arabia, Philippines, Thailand) and other countries such as Kuwait&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, this reflects the current majoritarian spending of procurement budget within the NATO. Legacy systems are still fuelled, althoughshifts happened over time given the allocation of research budget in the past &amp;amp; seeing automated/semi-autonomous systems being integratedwithin the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-shift-uavs--reconnaissance&#34;&gt;The shift: UAVs &amp;amp; reconnaissance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://schiebel.net&#34;&gt;Schiebel&lt;/a&gt; might not be known to everybody, given their niche product, but is one of the strongest defense companies in Austria.Their main selling point revolves around Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), which instantiate on a selected mission (althoughthey additionally cover a mine detection program) . This can be any  flight to take pictures of a specified target at alocation or monitoring infrastructure in remote areas. In defense context, understanding what happens at places you cannot directly reach(think enemy territory on the other of a mountain) and need high granularity (satellites will not work) is invaluable and can be covered byUAVs. Additional payloads beyond high-resolution cameras can be mounted to provide insights in dark environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Missile types cannot be flown by the Camcopter (the name of Schiebel&amp;rsquo;s product) and only a selected number of militaries have them at this stage.Specifically autonomous drones, which are marketed as a new primitive, remain sparse, with mostly the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Atomics_MQ-9_Reaper&#34;&gt;Predator/Reaper&lt;/a&gt;and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAI_Aksungur&#34;&gt;TAI/Bayraktar family&lt;/a&gt; being the only major products being produced at this stage by NATO members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might have heard of other NATO countries having drones on their own or developing these on their own (UK, France, EU), yet they remaindependent on their counterparts for allowing procurement of the existing UAV infrastructure, which remains fairly limited&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-newcomers-osint--data-infrastructure&#34;&gt;The newcomers: OSINT &amp;amp; data infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blackshark.ai&#34;&gt;Blackshark.ai&lt;/a&gt; rose to fame through Microsoft Flight Simulator. Seems odd, but the pixel mesh in its newest iteration was notas mushy as in predecessors thanks to Blackshark. Their work focuses on satellite data to be augmented by machine learning to include &amp;amp;extract more detailed information in real-time. Their &lt;a href=&#34;https://blackshark.ai/bisim-and-blackshark-ai-join-forces/&#34;&gt;deal&lt;/a&gt; withBISim is the start of their defense branch and more specifically to target capabilities with beyond the currentcapabilities with their annotation &amp;amp; finding tool &lt;a href=&#34;https://blackshark.ai/orcahuntr/&#34;&gt;Orca Huntr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use case for national defense is in Open Source Intelligence (short OSINT), especially extracting as much information for surveillanceand pot. targets on a regular basis. OSINT has very much grown in recent years, with more intelligence agencies investing largershares of their budgets. UAVs &amp;amp; their reconnaissance would be partly complementary, although the former focusing more on strikesrather than the information gathering. Knowing as much in advance as possible is necessary to not waste any additional resourceswithin a mission, namely your UAV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These software solutions represent the new way of combative strategy and level up the possibilities to develop &amp;amp; validate plans forconcrete missions to determine how to leverage the existing arsenal. A key player is Anduril with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.anduril.com/command-and-control/&#34;&gt;Lattice&lt;/a&gt;enabling C2 (command &amp;amp; control) capabilities for orchestration &amp;amp; coordination of actions. The NATO &amp;amp; existing large industry titans startedtheir &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.act.nato.int/article/nato-centres-of-excellence-command-and-control-c2-coe/&#34;&gt;initiative&lt;/a&gt; on their own, yet remains to beseen how novel architecture and tooling will be implemented within the upcoming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;piecing-the-new-procurement-strategy-together&#34;&gt;Piecing the new procurement strategy together&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the three parts, you can observe the switch from one step of the OODA to another. OODA stands for Observe, Orient, Decide &amp;amp; Act, a militarymantra to reach a decision. Whilst focusing on the Act part for most of the time, with soldiers being responsible for the rest, previous iterationsin procurement cycles were mostly spend on Act (again) and Observe. Only recently were Orient &amp;amp; Decide taken into account with the rise of MLsolutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, NATO &amp;amp; its members try to focus more of their budget research initiatives, clustering around autonomous systems (covering OODA whilst keeping the human within Decide)and new information gathering systems within their next generation of infrastructure (mainly on Observe &amp;amp; Orient). The major share of capitalremains allocated to legacy systems, with only limited thought in published strategies on how connect existing tools within the newset of requirements and the future of military systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is directly reflected within the defence industry in Austria: Major existing players staying on top, limited innovation to integrateinto new systems revolving around different aspects on the battefield than theirs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52023XG0216(01)&amp;amp;qid=1681985654900&amp;amp;from=De&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&#34;https://armstransfers.sipri.org/ArmsTransfer/TransferData/transferResults?logic=on&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_combat_aerial_vehicle#Current&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

       <title>Poor Tommy John: Ruining baseball&#39;s future</title>
       <link>https://pcorvin.github.io/posts/tommyjohn/</link>
       <pubDate>Sun, 01 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
       
       <guid>https://pcorvin.github.io/posts/tommyjohn/</guid>
       <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gQujXQQGOVNaiuwSN680Hq-FDVsCwvN-3AazykOBON0/edit#gid=0&#34;&gt;Tommy John Surgery Data&lt;/a&gt;, which provided all data used in this article!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Tommy John injured himself in 1974, he was out indefinitely. Nobody knew what was happening &amp;amp; no doctor was able to fix it. Tommy John (TJ) was not a high-performer but a stellar contributor across his 26 years in the league. The &amp;ldquo;Bionic Man&amp;rdquo; started a revolution in the sport of baseball, which heavily impacts it today: he heavily bruised his elbow &amp;amp; got it fixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When mentioning Tommy John Surgery today, friends of the national pastime show a disgusted face &amp;amp; grumble somthing like &amp;ldquo;looking forward to see him next year!&amp;rdquo;. What requires the procedure in the first place is the rupture of your ligament in your elbow (similar to the knee), which is then replaced by something from somewhere else of your body. As you might not from any MCL/ACL injuries, it takes time to train them &amp;amp; it is the same for your elbow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is this a problem though? Football pitchers &amp;amp; skiers break their legs over the years, and they are fine (they are not, different topic), right? Technically this also applies to baseball, although the rate of it happening is alarming. Tommy John would normally occur to pitchers only (the people throwing 160+ kph balls at you), as they overflex their elbows to execute their pitches (throws) with a maximum of velocity &amp;amp; break. Yet, currently the system breaks with the highest share of athletes needing Tommy John being 15 to 19 years old (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/765898&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Especially at this young age, having underdeveloped muscles &amp;amp; core, the pipeline for pitchers dries up faster than initially planned. This furthers thins out the number of pitchers available throughout the minors &amp;amp; major league, which is becoming increasingly difficult. Pitch count is the main metric coaches consider when replacing starting pitchers &amp;amp; bullpen arms. Looking at the age of pitchers getting TJ surgery, a worrying trend can be seen:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mid&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://pcorvin.github.io/age.png&#34;    alt=&#34;Pitchers are getting TJ surgery younger than ever over the past 20 years&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;      &lt;p&gt;Pitchers are getting TJ surgery younger than ever over the past 20 years&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite a recent uptick, the trend towards early TJ surgery was in decline, where the median age in 2000 was 24.2 years bottomed out at 21.98 in 2016 (9.17% drop). Recent years went back to original levels. Nevertheless, the constant rise in TJ surgeries is alarming, being close to triple of what it was 20 years ago (29 to 94). A key ingredient backing up this up is the general level when pitchers get their first TJ surgery, which goes from college as a majority up to the big leagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mid&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://pcorvin.github.io/levels.png&#34;    alt=&#34;An uptick in especially college pitchers is worrying, from 2010 onwards&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;      &lt;p&gt;An uptick in especially college pitchers is worrying, from 2010 onwards&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When putting this further into perspective of the two key major levels with TJ surgeries, we can clearly observe that reversal happening:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mid&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://pcorvin.github.io/coll_pro.png&#34;    alt=&#34;College pitchers got back to normal, MLB pitchers escalating&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;      &lt;p&gt;College pitchers got back to normal, MLB pitchers escalating&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Especially in the early 2024 season, MLB already reached the TJ levels of the past years, with the season just starting. Most of the changes on a college level can be traced back to athletics department setting a higher priority on preventing elbow injuries through easy pre-season programs &amp;amp; less wear in games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When considering the minor league system, we can relate back to the COVID times &amp;amp; the disproportionate number of wear &amp;amp; tear players aftermaths, as the minor league season was drastically reduced early on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;mid&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://pcorvin.github.io/minors.png&#34;    alt=&#34;The COVID hiccup in 2020 with a rebound in 2021&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;      &lt;p&gt;The COVID hiccup in 2020 with a rebound in 2021&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minor league injuries are at lower levels, especially compared to the number of total players in the system: Considering the ±270 players in a minor league system per club &amp;amp; the 40-man roster in MLB, the likelyhood of a TJ injury for one of the ± 14 pitchers is 4.62x likelier (5.083% vs. 1.098%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But what can we do?&lt;/strong&gt; Nothing. Especially offspeed pitchers are prone to TJ &amp;amp; will stay, given the extreme horizontal &amp;amp; vertical movement of pitches. Recent years were a success nevertheless, focusing more on pitch prevention (staying below 100 pitches) as well as the introduction of less intense off-speed pitches overall (hello sweeper!).
