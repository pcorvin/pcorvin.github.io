Chris Sale came to the Boston Red Sox as an absolute treasure. One of the great pitchers of his era, still firmly in his prime, Sale arrived in a blockbuster 2016 trade that signaled the Red Sox’s all-out pursuit of a championship. Within two years, he recorded the final out of the World Series. Sale was dominant and dependable, with a certain swagger that fit an organization at the top of the sport.

On Saturday, Sale left as an albatross. Traded in the final year of a five-year, $145 million extension that hamstrung the organization throughout its fall to the bottom of the American League East, Sale had become many of the things he never wanted to be on a baseball field. Unavailable. Unreliable. Overpaid. He’d become a wild card on a team that desperately needed stability.

The Red Sox traded Sale to the Atlanta Braves Saturday for 22-year-old infielder Vaughn Grissom.

“Anytime you trade someone like Sale who has made such a meaningful contribution to this organization and was obviously an incredibly important part of a World Series-winning team, it’s a really tough, tough decision,” chief baseball officer Craig Breslow said. “The fact that I wasn’t the chief baseball officer here didn’t diminish that in my mind at all. So it’s something that I was very mindful of and very thoughtful of, but in the end, I felt like this was a decision that was best for the Red Sox, both in the near term and the long term. So it was one that I needed to do.”

According to a person familiar with the terms of the transaction, the Red Sox will pay $17 million of Sale’s $27.5 million salary this season. With $10 million of Sale’s salary deferred, the Braves are getting him for next to nothing in the short term, but they’re giving up a good young player in the process.

The Red Sox are gaining long-term stability with Grissom, who various team sources said will move firmly into the mix at second base, where he’s expected to be at the top of the depth chart heading into spring training. Grissom still has six years of team control remaining and had a .921 OPS in Triple A last season. The Red Sox have had a revolving door at second base since the heyday of Dustin Pedroia.

Which is perhaps yet another reminder that injuries can derail even the greatest of careers.

Sale was one of baseball’s best starting pitchers from 2012 to 2018. He was a first-round MLB Draft pick in 2010 and got to the big leagues within months. After moving into the Chicago White Sox’s rotation in 2012, he finished top six in the American League Cy Young voting five years in a row while making five consecutive All-Star teams. The Red Sox acquired him in December 2016 for a prospect package headlined by Yoán Moncada — at the time, one of the top prospects in the sport — and Michael Kopech. Sale remained truly elite for two more years, just long enough to win the 2018 championship and sign an extension the following spring.

Then it all fell apart. Sale’s 2019 season was, at the time, the worst of his career, and late-season elbow inflammation proved a precursor to 2020 Tommy John surgery. He returned in late 2021 but struggled in the playoffs, then fractured a rib in the lead-up to 2022 spring training, broke his pinky in his second start off the injured list and broke his wrist in a bike accident late that season. Last year, Sale made 20 starts but also missed almost two months with a stress reaction in his scapula.

“I hate feeling like this,” Sale said when he was shut down in early June.

Throughout the setbacks and disappointments, Sale remained a popular teammate. His desire never waned. His body simply let him down. And when healthy, Sale was still an intimidating and motivating presence. Although his velocity dipped at times last season, his fastball still averaged between 93 and 94 mph. He still generated swing-and-miss and poor contact at rates better than 75 percent of pitchers in the league, according to Statcast. After a rocky first few outings last season, Sale had a 3.16 ERA in his last 15 starts.

But he also went more than five innings only once after May 20.

For a Braves team coming off a 104-win season, Sale might be a worthwhile gamble. At his best, he can still be a difference-maker, and the Red Sox believed even in years past that he would still have some trade value if he could just get into an offseason healthy. He finally did that this year. His contract includes a $20 million club option for 2025, which becomes guaranteed if he finishes top 10 in Cy Young voting and does not end 2024 on the injured list.
